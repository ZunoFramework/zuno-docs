# 🚀 Getting Started

Welcome to **Zuno Framework**! This guide will help you set up your first Zuno project in just a few minutes. Whether you're building a REST API, a secure microservice, or just exploring modern C++ web development—you're in the right place.

---

## 📦 Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **C++20 or newer** (Zuno uses modern C++ features)
- **CMake 3.16+**
- **A C++ compiler** (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- **Git** (for cloning the starter repo)

Optional but recommended:

- **OpenSSL** (for TLS support)

---

## 🧪 Quick Start (Using Starter Template)

The fastest way to get started is by cloning the official starter project:

<Code lang="bash" code={`git clone https://github.com/ZunoFramework/zuno-starter.git
cd zuno-starter
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
./build/zuno-app`} />

You should see:

<Code lang="bash" code="Zuno server running on http://localhost:3000" />

---

## 🛠️ Manual Setup (From Scratch)

Prefer to build it yourself? Here's how to set up a minimal Zuno project manually.

### 1. Create a new project folder

<Code lang="bash" code={`mkdir my-zuno-app
cd my-zuno-app`} />

### 2. Create a `CMakeLists.txt`

<Code lang="cmake" code={`cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)
project(my_zuno_app)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)

add_executable(zuno-app main.cpp)

# Link Zuno (assuming it's installed via vcpkg or system-wide)
find_package(Zuno REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(zuno-app PRIVATE Zuno::Zuno)`} />

### 3. Write your first server in `main.cpp`

<Code lang="cpp" code={`#include <zuno/zuno.hpp>

int main() {
  zuno::App app;

  app.get("/", [](auto& req, auto& res) {
    res.send("Hello from Zuno!");
  });

  app.listen(3000);
}`} />

### 4. Build and run

<Code lang="bash" code={`cmake -B build
cmake --build build
./build/zuno-app`} />

---

## 🔐 Enabling TLS (Optional)

If you want to serve over HTTPS, Zuno makes it easy:

<Code lang="cpp" code={`zuno::App app;

  app.get("/", [](auto& req, auto& res) {
    res.send("Hello from Zuno!");
  });

  app.useTLS({"server.crt", "server.key"});

  app.listen(443);`} />

Make sure your certificate and key files are valid and accessible.

---

## 🧭 Next Steps

Now that your server is running, you can:

- Explore [Routing & Controllers](/en/guide/routing)
- Add [Middleware](/en/guide/middleware) like CORS or compression
- Secure your app with [TLS & Security](/en/guide/tls-security)
