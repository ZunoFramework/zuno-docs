# 🦜 What is Zuno?

**Zuno** is a modern, high-performance web framework for C++ developers who want the power of low-level control with the elegance of a modular, expressive API. Inspired by the simplicity of frameworks like Express.js, Zuno brings that developer-friendly experience to the C++ ecosystem—without compromising on speed, security, or scalability.

---

## 🚀 Why Zuno?

Zuno was born from a simple idea: _C++ deserves a web framework that feels modern, intuitive, and fun to use._ While existing solutions often feel clunky or overly complex, Zuno is designed to be:

- **Modular** – Compose your application with lightweight, reusable components.
- **Secure** – Built-in TLS support and middleware for CORS, rate limiting, and more.
- **Performant** – Powered by [Asio standalone](https://think-async.com/Asio/), Zuno delivers blazing-fast networking with minimal overhead.
- **Developer-friendly** – Clean syntax, clear documentation, and a focus on DX (Developer Experience).

## 🧩 Core Concepts

Zuno is built around a few key ideas:

### 1. **Minimal by Default, Powerful by Design**

You can start with a simple “Hello World” server in just a few lines of code. But as your app grows, Zuno scales with you—offering advanced features like TLS, middleware chaining, and modular routing.

<Code lang="cpp" title='main.cpp' code={`#include <zuno/zuno.hpp>

int main() {
  zuno::App app;

  app.get("/", [](auto& req, auto& res) {
    res.send("Hello, Zuno!");
  });

  app.listen(3000);
}`}/>

### 2. **Middleware-Driven Architecture**

Zuno uses a middleware pipeline to handle requests. This makes it easy to plug in features like compression, logging, or authentication—without cluttering your core logic.

<Code lang="cpp" title='main.cpp' code={`app.use(cors());
app.use(rateLimit());

app.get("/hello", [](auto& req, auto& res) {
  res.send("Hello, world!");
});`} />

### 3. **Built for Modern C++**

Zuno embraces modern C++ standards (C++20 and above), using smart pointers, lambdas, and RAII to ensure safety and clarity.

## 🛠️ Use Cases

Zuno is ideal for:

- Building REST APIs with C++ backends
- Creating secure microservices with TLS
- Prototyping high-performance web apps
- Learning modern C++ through real-world projects
