# 🧠 Zuno Architecture

Zuno is designed as a modern, modular, high-performance HTTP framework for C++20. Its architecture is built around a middleware pipeline, an efficient routing engine, and direct integration with Asio for asynchronous operations.

## ⚙️ 1. HTTP Server (Asio)

Zuno uses [Asio](https://think-async.com/) as its networking backend to handle TCP connections efficiently and asynchronously. Each incoming connection is processed through an event loop without blocking threads.

---

## 🧵 2. Middleware Pipeline

Every request flows through a chain of middleware before reaching the final handler. This enables:

- Authentication
- Logging
- CORS
- Compression
- Rate limiting

Example:

<Code
  lang="cpp"
  code={`app.use(logging());
app.use(cors());
app.use(rateLimit({ .max = 10 }));`}
/>

Each middleware receives `(Request&, Response&, Next)` and can choose to continue or short-circuit the flow.

---

## 🧭 3. Routing Engine

Zuno implements a hierarchical router that supports:

- Static routes (`/about`)
- Dynamic routes (`/users/:id`)
- Query parameters (`?q=value`)
- Modular route grouping

The router maps the URL to an efficient match tree and dispatches to the appropriate handler.

---

## 🧠 4. Route Handlers

Handlers are lambdas that implement your business logic:

<Code
  lang="cpp"
  code={`app.get("/hello/:name", [](Request& req, Response& res) {
  res.send("Hello, " + req.params["name"]);
});`}
/>

They can return plain text, JSON, files, or any custom response.

---

## 📤 5. HTTP Response

Zuno provides a fluent API for building responses:

<Code
  lang="cpp"
  code={`res.status(200).json({
  { "message", "Success" }
});`}
/>

You can also send files, redirects, or custom headers.

---

## 🧱 Internal Modularity

Zuno is organized into reusable modules:

| Module            | Purpose                                      |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `core/`           | Server, routing, base types                  |
| `extensions/`     | Optional middleware (CORS, TLS, etc.)        |
| `examples/`       | Ready-to-run use cases                       |
| `zuno/zuno.hpp`   | Unified entry point for users                |

---

## 🔐 Secure by Design

Zuno promotes secure defaults:

- Native TLS support
- Authentication middleware
- Configurable rate limiting
- Safe headers by default
