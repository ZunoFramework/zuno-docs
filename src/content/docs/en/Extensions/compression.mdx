# 🗜️ Brotli Compression Extension

Zuno includes built-in support for **Brotli**, a modern compression algorithm that offers better compression ratios than Gzip. This extension automatically compresses HTTP responses when the client supports it—reducing bandwidth usage and improving load times.

---

## ⚙️ Enabling Brotli Compression

To enable Brotli compression globally, register the extension using `app.use()`:

<Code
  lang="cpp"
  code={`app.use(compression());`}
/>

Zuno will automatically:

- Detect if the client accepts `br` encoding
- Compress the response body using Brotli
- Set the appropriate `Content-Encoding: br` header

---

## 🧪 Example

<Code
  lang="cpp"
  code={`#include <zuno/zuno.hpp>

int main() {
  zuno::App app;

  app.use(compression());

  app.get("/data", [](Request& req, Response& res) {
    std::string largePayload = generateLargeJson();
    res.send(largePayload);
  });

  app.listen(3000);
}`}
/>

When a client sends:

<Code
  lang="http"
  code={`GET /data HTTP/1.1
Accept-Encoding: br`}
/>

Zuno responds with:

<Code
  lang="http"
  code={`HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Encoding: br
Content-Type: application/json
...compressed body...`}
/>

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- Brotli is only applied to responses above a certain size threshold (e.g. 1KB)
- Binary files (e.g. images, videos) are typically excluded
- Clients that do not support Brotli will receive uncompressed responses

---

## 🧭 Best Practices

- Use Brotli for large JSON, HTML, or text-based responses
- Avoid compressing already-compressed formats (e.g. `.zip`, `.png`)
- Monitor CPU usage in high-throughput environments
