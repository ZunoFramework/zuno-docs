# üåê CORS Extension

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature implemented by browsers to restrict how web pages can make requests to a different domain. Zuno includes a built-in CORS extension to help you configure access rules for your API.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Enabling CORS

To enable CORS with default settings (allow all origins), use:

<Code
  lang="cpp"
  code={`app.use(cors());`}
/>

This will:

- Allow all origins (`*`)
- Accept common HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, etc.)
- Enable basic headers

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is fine for development, but not recommended for production.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Custom Configuration

You can customize the behavior by passing an options object:

<Code
  lang="cpp"
  code={`app.use(cors({
  "https://example.com",
  "GET,POST",
  "Content-Type,Authorization",
}));`}
/>

### Available options:

| Option       | Type     | Description                                      |
|--------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `origin`     | `string` | Allowed origin (e.g. `"https://example.com"`)    |
| `methods`    | `string` | Allowed HTTP methods (comma-separated)           |
| `headers`    | `string` | Allowed request headers                          |
| `credentials`| `bool`   | Whether to allow cookies and credentials         |

## üß™ Example: Restrict to Trusted Frontend

<Code
  lang="cpp"
  code={`app.use(cors({
  "https://frontend.myapp.com",
  "GET,POST",
}));`}
/>

This configuration allows only your frontend app to access the API and supports cookies or tokens.

---

## üîç Preflight Requests

Zuno automatically handles `OPTIONS` preflight requests when CORS is enabled. You don‚Äôt need to define them manually.

---

## üß≠ Best Practices

- Always restrict `origin` in production
- Enable `credentials` only when needed
- Avoid using `*` with `credentials: true` (not allowed by browsers)
- Use HTTPS to prevent mixed-content issues
