# 🦜 About Zuno

**Zuno** is a modern C++ web framework designed for developers who want the performance of native code with the simplicity of expressive APIs.

Whether you're building microservices, APIs, or fullstack apps, Zuno gives you the tools to move fast—without sacrificing control.

---

## 🎯 Why Zuno?

Most C++ web frameworks are either:

- Too low-level (e.g. raw Boost.Beast)
- Too complex to integrate
- Or lack modern ergonomics

Zuno changes that by offering:

- 🧩 Expressive routing and middleware
- 🔐 Native TLS support
- 🧵 Lightweight and dependency-free core
- 🧱 Modular architecture with `FetchContent` support
- 🧠 Familiar patterns inspired by Express.js and Fastify

---

## 🚀 Who is it for?

Zuno is built for:

- C++ developers building APIs or microservices
- Embedded or edge applications needing HTTP interfaces
- Teams that want full control over performance and deployment
- Developers who love C++ but hate boilerplate

---

## 🧬 Philosophy

- **Minimal by default** – no macros, no magic
- **Modular by design** – everything is opt-in
- **Modern C++** – clean, readable, and expressive
- **Secure-first** – TLS, rate limiting, and CORS built-in
- **Developer experience** – great docs, fast builds, and clear errors

---

## 🛠️ Built With

Zuno is powered by:

- **Asio standalone** for async networking
- **CMake + FetchContent** for easy integration
- **Standard C++20+** – no external runtime dependencies
