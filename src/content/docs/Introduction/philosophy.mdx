# 🧠 Framework Philosophy

Zuno isn’t just a tool—it’s a philosophy. It’s built on the belief that **C++ developers deserve a modern, elegant, and joyful web development experience**. Every design decision in Zuno is guided by a few core principles:

---

## ✨ 1. Developer Experience is Everything

Zuno is designed to feel intuitive and expressive from the very first line of code. You shouldn’t need to fight the language or the framework to build something meaningful.

- Clear, minimal APIs
- Sensible defaults
- Helpful error messages
- First-class documentation

> If it feels clunky, we fix it. If it feels magical, we document it.

---

## 🧱 2. Modularity Over Monoliths

Zuno encourages composition. Instead of bloated, all-in-one abstractions, it gives you small, focused building blocks that you can combine however you like.

<Code lang="cpp" code={`app.use(cors());
app.use(compression());
app.use(rateLimit());`} />

Each middleware is optional. Each feature is opt-in. You stay in control.

---

## ⚡ 3. Performance Without Pain

Zuno is built on top of [Asio standalone](https://think-async.com/Asio/), giving it the raw performance of asynchronous I/O—but with a clean, high-level API that doesn’t require you to manage threads or callbacks manually.

<Code lang="cpp" code={`app.get("/metrics", [](auto& req, auto& res) {
  res.json({ "uptime": getUptime(), "status": "ok" });
});`} />

You get the speed of C++ with the simplicity of a scripting language.

---

## 🔐 4. Security is a First-Class Citizen

From day one, Zuno includes built-in support for:

- TLS encryption
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting

Security isn’t an afterthought—it’s baked into the core.

---

## 🛠️ 5. Built for Real-World Projects

Zuno isn’t a toy framework. It’s designed to power production-grade APIs, microservices, and backend systems. Whether you’re building a small prototype or a large-scale service, Zuno adapts to your needs.

- Modular routing
- Middleware pipelines
- Static file serving
- TLS-ready servers

---

## 🧭 6. Clarity Over Cleverness

We value code that’s easy to read, easy to debug, and easy to maintain. Zuno avoids unnecessary abstractions and favors clarity over clever tricks.

<Code lang="cpp" code={`app.get("/health", [](auto& req, auto& res) {
  res.send("OK");
});`}/>

If a new developer can’t understand it in 10 seconds, we rethink the design.

---

## 🌍 7. Community-Driven Evolution

Zuno is open-source and community-first. We believe the best ideas come from real developers solving real problems. That’s why we:

- Welcome contributions and feedback
- Prioritize transparency in roadmap decisions
- Build features based on real-world use cases

---

## 🦜 The Zuno Ethos

Zuno is fast, secure, and modular—but more than that, it’s **human-friendly**. It’s a framework that respects your time, your creativity, and your craft.

> We’re not just building a framework—we’re building a better way to write C++ for the web.
