# ðŸš€ Getting Started with Zuno

This guide will walk you through installing Zuno, building your first server, and understanding the basics of how the framework works.

---

## ðŸ“¦ 1. Install Zuno

Zuno is written in C++ and uses CMake as its build system. Clone the repository and build it locally:

```bash
mkdir include
cd include/
git clone https://github.com/ZunoFramework/zuno.git
cd zuno
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
./zuno-example # To run Zuno example
```

This should build and run the default example server.

---

## ðŸ§­ 2. Create a basic Zuno app

Create a file called `main.cpp`:

```cpp
#include <zuno/zuno.hpp>;

int main() {
  zuno::App app;

  app.get("/", [](const zuno::Request&, zuno::Response& res) {
    res.send("Hello, world from Zuno!");
  });

  app.listen(3000);
}
```

Then compile:

```bash
g++ main.cpp -std=c++20 -o myserver -I./include -L./lib -lzuno -lpthread
./myserver
```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## ðŸ§© 3. Explore Middleware and Routing

Add another route:

```cpp
app.use([](zuno::Request& req, zuno::Response& res, zuno::Next next) {
  std::cout << "Request received for " << req.path << std::endl;
  next();
});

app.get("/about", [](const zuno::Request&, zuno::Response& res) {
  res.send("Zuno is alive!");
});
```

This demonstrates how middleware and routing interact.
