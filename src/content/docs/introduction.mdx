# 🧠 What is Zuno?

**Zuno** is a lightweight HTTP framework for C++ that prioritizes _true performance_, expressive simplicity, and full developer control. Inspired by the elegance of Express.js and the raw power of C++, Zuno is ideal for:

- Blazingly fast REST APIs
- Embedded servers on limited-resource systems
- Projects where every millisecond matters

## 🚀 Key Features
- 🔁 Chainable middleware, Express-style
- 🛠️ Simple yet powerful routing
- 🧩 Optional extensions like Brotli compression and static serve
- 🧵 Ready for asynchronous systems via ASIO

```cpp
app.get("/hello", [](Request&, Response& res) {
  res.send("Hello, Zuno!");
});
```
