# 🗂️ Project Structure

Zuno is flexible—you can start with a single `main.cpp` file or scale up to a fully modular architecture. This guide shows you how to structure your project for clarity and maintainability.

---

## 🧪 Minimal Example

Here’s the simplest possible Zuno project:

<Code lang="text" code={`my-zuno-app/
├── CMakeLists.txt
└── main.cpp`} />

This is great for quick experiments or learning the basics.

---

## 🧱 Recommended Structure

For real-world projects, we recommend a modular layout:

<Code lang="text" code={`my-zuno-app/
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── src/
│   ├── main.cpp
│   ├── routes/
│   │   ├── index.cpp
│   │   └── users.cpp
│   ├── middleware/
│   │   └── auth.cpp
│   └── utils/
│       └── logger.cpp
├── cmake/
│   └── dependencies.cmake
├── include/
│   └── my_zuno_app/
│       ├── routes.hpp
│       ├── middleware.hpp
│       └── utils.hpp
└── certs/
    ├── cert.pem
    └── key.pem
`}/>

---

## 📁 Folder Breakdown

### `src/`
Contains all your application logic.

- `main.cpp`: Entry point of your app.
- `routes/`: Define route handlers here.
- `middleware/`: Custom middleware functions.
- `utils/`: Helper functions, logging, etc.

### `include/`
Public headers for your app. Useful for separating declarations and enabling reuse.

### `cmake/`
Contains CMake configuration files used for building the project. These files define how the project is compiled, linked, and managed across different platforms.

### `certs/`
Store TLS certificates and keys here if you're using HTTPS.

## 🧩 Example: Modular Route

Here’s how you might define a route in `routes/index.cpp`:

<Code lang="cpp" code={`#include <zuno/zuno.hpp>

void registerIndexRoutes(zuno::App& app) {
    app.get("/", [](auto& req, auto& res) {
        res.send("Welcome to Zuno!");
    });
}`} />

And in `main.cpp`:

<Code lang="cpp" code={`#include <zuno/zuno.hpp>
#include "routes.hpp"

int main(){
    zuno::App app;
    registerIndexRoutes(app);
    app.listen(3000);
}`}/>

Keep your code clean, modular, and expressive. Zuno makes it easy.
