# üì¶ Installation

Zuno is designed to be easy to install and integrate into any modern C++ project. You can install it using **CMake Fetch Content**, or build it manually from source if you prefer full control.

---

## ‚úÖ Recommended: Install via CMake Fetch Content

The easiest way to get started is by using [CMake Fetch Content](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html), a feature that allows you to include external projects directly in your CMake configuration.

### 1. Configure Your Project

Add the following lines to your `CMakeLists.txt` file:

<Code lang="cmake" code={`cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)
project(my_zuno_app)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20)

include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
  zuno
  GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/ZunoFramework/zuno.git
  GIT_TAG        main
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(zuno)

add_executable(zuno-app main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(zuno-app PRIVATE zuno)`} />

### 2. Build Your Project

Run the following commands to build your project:

<Code lang="bash" code={`cmake -B build
cmake --build build`} />

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Alternative: Build from Source

If you prefer to build Zuno manually (e.g. for debugging or contributing), follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository

<Code lang="bash" code={`git clone https://github.com/ZunoFramework/zuno.git
cd zuno`} />

### 2. Build the library

<Code lang="bash" code={`cmake -B build
cmake --build build`} />

### 3. Link it in your project

Make sure to include the `include/` directory and link against the compiled static or shared library.

## üß™ Verify Installation

To confirm that Zuno is installed correctly, try compiling this minimal example:

<Code lang="cpp" code={`#include &lt;zuno/zuno.hpp&gt;

int main() {
  zuno::App app;
  app.get("/", [](auto& req, auto& res) {
    res.send("Zuno is working!");
  });
  app.listen(3000);
}`}/>

Compile and run:

<Code lang="bash" code={`cmake -B build
cmake --build build
./build/zuno-app`} />


You should see:

<Code lang="text" code={`Zuno server running on http://localhost:3000`} />

## üß≠ Next Steps

Now that Zuno is installed, continue with:

- [Routing & Controllers](/guide/routing)
- [Middleware System](/guide/middleware)
