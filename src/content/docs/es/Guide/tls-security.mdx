# 🔐 TLS & Security

Zuno is built with security in mind. From native TLS support to middleware for CORS and rate limiting, it gives you the tools to build secure, production-ready applications.

---

## 🔒 Enabling HTTPS with TLS

Zuno supports HTTPS out of the box using TLS. You just need a certificate and a private key.

<Code lang="cpp" code={`app.useTLS({
  "certs/cert.pem",
  "certs/key.pem"
});`}/>


Make sure your certificate files are valid and accessible. You can generate self-signed certificates for development using OpenSSL:

<Code lang="bash" code={`openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes`} />

---

## 🌐 CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

To control which domains can access your API, use the built-in CORS middleware:

<Code lang="cpp" code={`app.use(cors({
  .origin = "https://example.com",
  .methods = "GET,POST",
  .headers = "Content-Type"
}));`} />


You can also allow all origins (not recommended for production):

<Code lang="cpp" code={`app.use(cors());`} />

---

## 🚦 Rate Limiting

Prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks by limiting the number of requests per client:

<Code lang="cpp" code={`app.use(rateLimit({
  60000,     // 1 minute
  100     // per IP
}));`} />

This middleware tracks IP addresses and blocks excessive requests.

---

## 🧼 Input Validation (Coming Soon)

Zuno will soon include utilities for validating query parameters, request bodies, and headers. For now, you can implement your own checks inside route handlers or middleware.

<Code lang="cpp" code={`app.post("/login", [](auto& req, auto& res) {
  if (req.body.empty()) {
    res.status(400).send("Missing credentials");
    return;
  }
  // Proceed with authentication...
});`} />


---

## 🧭 Best Practices

- Always use HTTPS in production
- Use CORS to restrict access to trusted domains
- Apply rate limiting to public endpoints
- Validate all user input
- Avoid exposing internal error messages

---

## 🧭 Next Steps

Now that your app is secure, continue with:

- [Error Handling](/es/guide/error-handling)
- [Static File Serving](/es/middleware/static-files)

Security isn’t optional—it’s foundational. Zuno helps you build with confidence.
