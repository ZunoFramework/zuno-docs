title: 🧰 Middleware
description: Add reusable logic to your request pipeline using middleware functions.

import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Middleware functions in Zuno allow you to intercept and process HTTP requests before they reach the final route handler. They are powerful tools for implementing cross-cutting concerns like logging, authentication, input validation, and error handling.

---

## ⚙️ What is Middleware?

A middleware is a function that receives three arguments:

- `req`: the incoming request
- `res`: the response object
- `next`: a function that passes control to the next middleware or route

<Code title="basic-logging.cpp" lang="cpp" code={`app.use([](auto req, auto res, auto next) {
  std::cout << "[LOG] " << req.method() << " " << req.path() << std::endl;
  next(); // Pass control to the next middleware or route
});`} />

---

## 🧵 Execution Order

Middlewares are executed in the order they are registered. If a middleware does not call `next()`, the request will not proceed to the next handler.

<Code title="block-request.cpp" lang="cpp" code={`app.use([](auto req, auto res, auto next) {
  if (req.path() == "/blocked") {
    res.status(403).send("Access denied");
    return;
  }
  next();
});`} />

---

## 🔐 Authentication Example

You can use middleware to enforce authentication logic before allowing access to protected routes. This example checks for a bearer token in the `Authorization` header:

<Code title="auth.cpp" lang="cpp" code={`app.use([](auto req, auto res, auto next) {
  auto token = req.header("Authorization");
  if (token != "Bearer secret-token") {
    res.status(401).send("Unauthorized");
    return;
  }
  next();
});`} />

---

## 🔍 Using Query Parameters in Middleware

Since Zuno supports `req.query()`, you can access query parameters directly in your middleware logic:

<Code title="query-check.cpp" lang="cpp" code={`app.use([](auto req, auto res, auto next) {
  auto debug = req.query("debug");
  if (debug == "true") {
    std::cout << "[DEBUG] Request to " << req.path() << std::endl;
  }
  next();
});`} />

---

## 🧪 Middleware + Routes

Middleware runs before any matching route. You can combine them to build clean, layered logic:

<Code title="combined.cpp" lang="cpp" code={`app.use([](auto req, auto res, auto next) {
  std::cout << "Incoming: " << req.method() << " " << req.path() << std::endl;
  next();
});

app.get("/hello", [](auto req, auto res) {
  res.send("Hello, world!");
});`} />

---

## 🧰 Reusable Middleware Functions

You can define middleware as reusable functions and apply them globally or conditionally:

<Code title="middleware-utils.cpp" lang="cpp" code={`auto log_requests = [](auto req, auto res, auto next) {
  std::cout << "[LOG] " << req.method() << " " << req.path() << std::endl;
  next();
};

app.use(log_requests);`} />

---

## 🧱 Middleware Stack Internals

Zuno maintains an internal stack of middleware functions. When a request is received:

1. The first middleware is called.
2. If it calls `next()`, the next middleware is invoked.
3. Once all middleware has run, the matching route handler is executed.
4. If no route matches, a 404 response is returned.

---

## ⚠️ Error Handling in Middleware

You can wrap your logic in `try/catch` blocks to handle exceptions gracefully:

<Code title="error-handling.cpp" lang="cpp" code={`app.use([](auto req, auto res, auto next) {
  try {
    next();
  } catch (const std::exception& e) {
    res.status(500).send("Internal Server Error");
  }
});`} />

---

## 🧪 Middleware Best Practices

- Keep middleware functions small and focused.
- Always call `next()` unless you want to terminate the request.
- Use middleware for logging, auth, validation, and error handling.
- Register middleware before your routes.
