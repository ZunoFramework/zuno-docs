# 🗂️ Static File Serving

Zuno includes built-in support for serving static files—perfect for delivering frontend assets, documentation, or public resources like images and stylesheets.

---

## 📁 Serving a Public Directory

To serve a folder (e.g. `public/`) as static content, use the `staticFiles()` middleware:

<Code
  lang="cpp"
  code={`app.use(staticFiles("public"));`}
/>

This will make all files inside `public/` accessible via HTTP:

<Code
  lang="text"
  code={`public/
├── index.html
├── styles.css
└── images/
    └── logo.png`}
/>

- `/index.html` → `http://localhost:3000/index.html`
- `/images/logo.png` → `http://localhost:3000/images/logo.png`

---

## 🧪 Example: Serving a Landing Page

<Code
  lang="cpp"
  code={`#include &lt;zuno/zuno.hpp&gt;

int main() {
  zuno::App app;

  // Serve static files from the "public" folder
  app.use(staticFiles("public"));

  app.listen(3000);
}`}
/>

---

## ⚙️ Advanced Options (Coming Soon)

Future versions of `staticFiles()` will support:

- Custom cache headers
- Directory listing toggle
- File extension fallbacks (e.g. `.html`)

---

## 🧭 Best Practices

- Place only public assets in the static folder
- Avoid exposing sensitive files (e.g. `.env`, `.git`)
- Use a CDN for large or high-traffic assets in production

---
