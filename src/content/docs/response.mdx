# 📨 Responses in Zuno

The `Response` object in Zuno gives you full control over what the server returns to the client—including headers, status codes, body content, and more.

---

## 🟢 Sending a Response

Use `.send()` to return a string, HTML, JSON, or raw data:

```cpp
res.send("Hello, world!");
res.send("<h1>Hello Zuno</h1>");
```

---

## 🧾 Setting Headers

You can set custom headers using `.setHeader()`:

```cpp
res.setHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");
res.setHeader("X-Developer", "Seobryn");
```

Zuno will handle common defaults automatically if not overridden.

---

## 🎯 Changing Status Code

By default, responses use status code `200 OK`, but you can set any code:

```cpp
res.status(404).send("Not found");
res.status(201).send("Resource created");
```

You can chain `.status()` and `.send()` together or call them separately.

---

## 🔁 Redirects

Use `.redirect()` to send a `302` redirect to a new path:

```cpp
res.redirect("/new-location");
```

Optionally, specify a different status code:

```cpp
res.redirect(301, "/permanent-home");
```

---

## 🧠 JSON Responses

Zuno doesn’t automatically serialize structs to JSON (yet), but you can prepare strings manually:

```cpp
res.setHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");
res.json({{"success":true,"user":"Jose"}});
```

---

## 🧵 Streaming Responses

Coming soon: stream large responses using async write or generator-like APIs.

---

The `Response` API is built for clarity and precision. You send exactly what you mean—with no guesswork or hidden behavior.
