# 🧩 Zuno Extensions

Zuno includes optional middleware components to enhance functionality without adding complexity. These extensions help you compress, secure, and scale your app.

---

## 🌀 Brotli Compression

Reduces response size using Brotli if the client supports it:

```cpp
app.use(zuno::compression());
```

By default, responses are compressed only if they reduce size by 20% or more (`0.8` ratio). You can customize this threshold:

```cpp
app.use(zuno::compression(0.7)); // Accept smaller gains
```

✅ Sets `Content-Encoding: br` and respects `Accept-Encoding`.

---

## 🌐 CORS

Allows cross-origin requests (great for SPAs and frontend development):

```cpp
app.use(zuno::cors());
```

Default behavior:

- Allows all origins
- Methods: `GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS`
- Headers: `Content-Type`

Customize if needed:

```cpp
app.use(zuno::cors({
  .origin = "https://myfrontend.dev",
  .methods = "GET, POST",
  .headers = "Content-Type, Authorization"
}));
```

---

## 🚦 Rate Limiting

Limit the number of requests per client/IP in a given timeframe:

```cpp
app.use(zuno::rateLimit({
  .max = 100,
  .intervalMs = 60000
}));
```

Useful for API protection and abuse mitigation.

Zuno extensions help you scale while keeping control. They’re modular by design—add only what you need and keep your server fast and focused.

**What’s next?** Consider writing your own middleware or exploring advanced topics like headers, streaming, or asynchronous response flows.
